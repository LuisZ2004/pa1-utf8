If all characters in UTF-32 are 4 bytes then characters that do not need all 4 bytes are going to be using memory for charcters that do not require the amount allocated. For example 1 could just be 00000001 (1 byte) in utf-8 or but it would be 00000000 000000000 00000000 00000001 in utf-32. However it may be easier to read utf-32 because if all characters are 32 bits then there is no need to have identifier bits, they would all be from the same library. Another benefit is that the number of characters would also increase because the bits previously used as idenifier bits could now be used as different characters.

The lack of the leading 10 would make it harder to identify where in the string you were. You could be on a single character or in the middle of a multibyte character. I think that the leading one is useful for recognizing this and also recognizing that it is infact a charcter and not a number.
